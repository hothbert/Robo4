# Robo4

Welcome to our project.

To run the project, simply open terminal and navigate to the directory Robo4.

Once in the directory, please source ROS with the command: "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash"

Then build the package with the command: "colcon build"

Then run the command: "source install/local_setup.bash"

Before finally running the command: "ros2 launch robo4_project robo4_project_launch.py"

This will open Webots and run the program. (You may need to install Webots on your machine if not installed)
